# Wage-Slave-Adventure

The frontend and slash_server is written in godot 4.2, while the general_server is written in Express.js. The general_server is written very roughly. To run it, a key pair should be generated in frontend and slash_server. Some env variables should be set. I am not sure if that's all but I am sure that it won't be easy to run it. because I need to remove the credentials and things specific for me, but I probably forgot what I have removed.
